## **Elastic Scattering**

In elastic scattering, the energy and wavelength of the scattered wave remain unchanged. Common types include:

- **Rayleigh Scattering**: Occurs when particles are much smaller than the wavelength of light. It is wavelength-dependent, scattering shorter wavelengths more effectively, which explains phenomena like the blue sky
- **Mie Scattering**: Happens when particle sizes are comparable to or larger than the wavelength of light. It is less dependent on wavelength and produces non-uniform scattering, such as the white appearance of clouds
- **Thomson Scattering**: Elastic scattering by free charged particles without energy transfer.
- **Non Selective Scattering** : When particles are a lot bigger, eg water droplets. Scatters every em wave equally.

Example: Reason why sky appears blue, because blue scatters more. During sunrise or set, sun is at horizon and light has to travel a lot so all blue light gets scattered off. (Rayleigh Scattering). Clouds appear white because of non selective scattering.

Longwave radiation (LWR) in remote sensing refers to thermal infrared radiation emitted by Earth's surface, atmosphere, and clouds, typically spanning wavelengths from **3–100 µm** (with **8–15 µm** being most critical for terrestrial applications). It is distinct from reflected shortwave solar radiation and plays a pivotal role in Earth's energy balance and climate studies.

# Absorption --

Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption by the atmosphere occurs when specific gases and particles convert incoming or outgoing radiation into thermal energy or molecular vibrations. This process is wavelength-dependent and governed by the atomic/molecular structure of atmospheric constituents.
#### Selective Absorption: 
Atmospheric gases like water vapor (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and ozone (O₃) absorb photons at specific wavelengths corresponding to their resonant frequencies
1. Water Vapour absorbs strongly in infrared (IR) regions (e.g., 3.106 µm, 6.08 µm, and 2.903 µm) due to molecular vibrations
2. CO₂ has absorption bands near 1400, 1600, and 2000 nm, contributing to the greenhouse effect
3. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation, shielding the Earth from harmful solar UV rays.


#### Atmospheric Window --

Parts of the spectreum which are not severely influenced by atmospheric absorption are useful to remote sensors are called atmospheric windows.
