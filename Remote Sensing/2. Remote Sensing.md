## EM radiation interactions --

 Radiation interacts with the target in different ways --
 1. Reflection
 2. Absoption
 3. Transmission

### Specular vs Diffuse Reflection --
Specular reflection (mirror like) occurs when surface is smooth occurs in calm sea, diffuse occurs when surface is rough. Most earth objects are somewhere i between.
Specular reflection primarily reflects incident radiation without interacting significantly with the material's internal properties. As a result, it provides minimal spectral data about the surface composition. Diffuse reflection interacts deeply with the surface material, revealing spectral signatures that are essential for identifying features such as vegetation health or soil composition.


## Spectral Response --

**Spectral response** refers to the measure of how an object or material reflects, absorbs, or emits electromagnetic energy across different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is a fundamental concept in remote sensing and determines how sensors detect and differentiate various surface features.

**Spectral Signature**:
- Each material has a unique spectral response pattern, often referred to as its _spectral signature_. This pattern allows remote sensing systems to identify and classify objects such as vegetation, soil, water, and urban features

**Graphical Representation**:
- The spectral response of an object is typically represented as a **spectral reflectance curve**, which plots wavelength (x-axis) against reflectance or radiance (y-axis). Peaks in the curve indicate strong reflection, while valleys indicate absorption.

Spectral response of target with different wavelengths. Sometimes we need to consult various channels before making judgements. Spectral curves are used to determine

 Landsat has multiple bands 1,2,3,4,5,7. If we  refer to Atmospheric window [[1. Types of Scattering  & Absorption-]], we can see why there is gaps between 2,3,4,5,6,7. Also notes the bands should not be very wide, cause that might give us some inaccuracy (self explanatory). Also its important to note in infra red and microwave regions the the % of radiation reaching is very less hence e use broad band sensors.
