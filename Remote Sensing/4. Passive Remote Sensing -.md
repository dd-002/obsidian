The more thin the lobe the more directional the antenna is. **Hypothetically a perfect antenna will collect information from a single straight line.** 

#### Antenna Temperature --

Surface temperature and emissivity are of earth, receiving pattern of antenna (noise, antennas actual temperature). The last part is removed during pre-processing.

Earlier we were talking in terms of specrtral radiance but using rayleigh jean approximation we can directly use Temperature since there is a linear relationship.
