## Active Remote Sensing --

Monostatic mode is when there is one antenna for both transmission and receiving and bistatic when we have two antennas. 

1. Radar transmits microwave em radiation towards a scene through transmitter.
2. Pulse interacts with earth surface and backscatters towards RADAR antenna reciever.
3. RADAR observes the strength ( Detection) and the time delay (RANGING) of the return signals

#### Imaging vs Non imaging RADARs --
Radar sets can be roughly divided into two categories: Imaging radar techniques (imaging radar) and non-imaging radar techniques (non-imaging radar). Imaging radar methods attempt to calculate a map-like image from the received information. Classic applications are weather radar and military air surveillance radar.
Non-imaging radar methods make their measurement results available as pure numerical values. Applications include some radar altimeters and speedometers. Non-Imaging Secondary Radar applications are immobilizer systems in some recent private cars.

***Note* : Imaging radars need to be side looking to prevent left right ambiguity. In nadir looking radars we cant say if it came from left or right.**

#### Terminologies

Note look angle and incidence angle is only same in flat surface.

### Polarisation in Active Remote Sensing --
![[Pasted image 20250407172803.png]]

There can be HV,VH as well. HV - Horizontal send. vertical receive. This is cross polarisation. 

### Slant Range vs Ground range distance --

In flat and horizontal ground -

Due to slant range objects near seem compressed as compared to  far objects.
For flat surfaces conversion is simple trigonometry.

However for non flat surfaces we require DEM to remove distortions.

#### Spatial Resolution in RADAR images -
The spatial resolution has 2 components 
1. Range resolution
2. Azimuth resolution

***Range Resolution*** -
The range resolution is proportional to the  pulse length of the RADAR signal 
Slant range resolution = $(tc)/2$
Ground range resolution = $(tc)/(2cos(\theta_d))$
![[Pasted image 20250407180447.png]]

Pulse length = $t*c /2$  , where t is time of transmission of pulse, c is speed of light 
**Proof** -
![[Pasted image 20250407182656.png]]
The part of the pulse backscattered by building A is PA, and the part of the pulse backscattered by building B is PB.
It appears in the lower part of the figure that to reach the target and come back, PB has covered an extra distance 2d, and thus is at a slightly shorter distance than L behind PA.
Because of this, the end of PA and the beginning of PB overlap when they reach the antenna. As a consequence, they are imaged as one single large target which extends from A to B.
If the slant range distance between A and B were slightly higher than L/2, the two pulses would not overlap and the two signals would be recorded separately.
Range resolution (across track resolution) is approximately equal to L/2, i.e. half the pulse length.

**As per Ground range resolution we can see the for near regions GRR is larger as compared to far range. Which implies the pixel is coarse nearby and more fine as far as we get.**

Also, we can decrease the the time of transmission we can get a finer spatial resolution in the range direction, however this would affect the power of the wave and we will have a low SNR, and it would be diificult tpo differentiate between noise and the echo.


***Azimuth Resolution*** -
![[Pasted image 20250407200057.png]]

 $\lambda$ is wavelength of the radiation we are using, L is the physical length of the antenna**
as we move far azimuth resolution gets coarse, as we move near we get finer resolution.

**This is why we cannot use real aperture radars in space borne satellites because S is very long so azimuth resolution is of hundreds of kilometer order.
Pixel dimensions vary we get scaled distortions in real aperture radars.
