## Blackbody --
An ideal body is now defined, called a blackbody. A blackbody allows all incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs all the incident radiation (**no energy transmitted through the body**). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence.
 A blackbody in **thermal equillibrium** has equal rates of absorption and emission, and this happens simultaneously.

**Doubt** - There might be a doubt as to why this isnt reflection. refer to this https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/832829/how-is-a-black-body-radiating-light-different-from-reflecting-it


## Planck's Law 
Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature. It is foundational to quantum mechanics and modern physics. 
In the context of Planck's law, spectral radiance describes ==the power emitted by a blackbody per unit area, per unit solid angle, and per unit frequency (or wavelength)==.

This is for blackbody only, with emmisivity 1.

#### Implications of Planck's Law --
1. More long-wavelength quanta must fall on a detector to produce measurable response compared with the number of shorter wavelength quanta. Hence spatial resolution of say visible light remote sensing is more than that of infra red or microwave.
2. Systems aimed at long-wavelength radiation need to collect radiation either from a larger target area or over a longer time than those used for shorter wavelengths. 

#### Rayleigh-Jean Approximation --
1. **for black bodies** --
	$L_\lambda \approx(2kcT)/\lambda^4$
2. **for non black bodies --**
	$L_\lambda \approx((2kcT)/\lambda^4)*e_\lambda$  , where $e_\lambda$ is emissivity. Holds good in microwave region

______

## Stefan-Boltzman Law --
The **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** describes the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body as proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. It is fundamental in thermodynamics and astrophysics.
We get this after integrating Planck's law. 
_____

## Weins Displacement Law --
Wien's Displacement Law is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the relationship between the temperature of a blackbody and the wavelength at which it emits radiation most intensely. It explains how the peak wavelength of emitted radiation shifts as the temperature of the blackbody changes.

#### Implications --
 1. Selection of Wavelength Bands

## Kirchoff's Law --
ref -- https://tfaws.nasa.gov/TFAWS12/Proceedings/Form%20Factors%20Grey%20Bodies%20and%20Radks%20Course.pdf

Absoptivity a of a substance for radiation $\lambda$ is equal to emissivity e for the same wavelength  is given by :
$a(\lambda) =e(\lambda)$       [valid for both grey and blackmbody]
However any grey object which recieves radiation disposes a part of it in reflection and transmission.
$1=a(\lambda)+t(\lambda)+r(\lambda)$     [a is absoptivity, t is transmissivity, r is reflectivity]

<aside style="background-color:black; color:orange">Rocks and mineral exhibit important (diagnostic/discriminating) signatures in their spectral emissivity in the thermal infrared (TIR) region. Measuring spectral emissivity in a laboratory (particularly if samples have to be characterized for their properties in natural conditions) is a quite difficult task due to the difficulty to insolate the sample from the lab environment (and instruments themselves) all emitting approximately at the same (environmental) temperature. Kirchoff's law allows to obtain, for opaque bodies, spectral emissivities from spectral reflectances measurements which are much easy to realize in normal remote sensing labs. </aside>

Kirchoff's law is a way of using spectral reflectance in place of spectral emmisivity.
